# Cambridge3DS
3DS port of Cambridge, the open-source arcade stacker. Consider this a fork of https://github.com/Rexxt/cambridge

## Known Issues
(I don't know how to fix these, or I'm too lazy)
- Replays do not load (replay button on menu was removed because of this)
- Pressing a touch screen button, then releasing on a different button causes the button to get stuck until pressed again
- Only the top half of blocks render
- Sliders do not display properly
- Game lags a lot (at least on O3DS)
